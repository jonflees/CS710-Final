# CS710-Final
Zillow Home Value Index visualizations on map (still version and motion version both included)

# Instructions
- The code should run smoothly if you just run each code block in order. 
- Make sure to install any packages needed to run the code (they are at the top). 
- There is code included for how I was able to get the latitude and longitude coordinates for each city, but it is commented out and does not need to be run. You will need a Google Developer account (free) and generate an API key to run this part.
- The animation part of the code takes about 5 minutes to render and produce the animation.
